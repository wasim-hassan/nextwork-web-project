## Introduction
This project is used for an introduction to creating and deploying a Java-based web app using AWS, especially their CI/CD tools.

The deployment pipeline I'm building around the Java web app in this repository is invisible to the end-user, but makes a big impact by automating the software release processes.

* I'm doing this project to learn more about CI/CD and get hands on experience in automating the flow form developing code to deployed web app.

## Technologies
Here’s what I’m using for this project:

- **Amazon EC2**: I'm developing my web app on Amazon EC2 virtual servers, so that software development and deployment happens entirely on the cloud.
* Key pairs, SSH connections, Git, Maven and Java.
- **VS Code**: For my IDE, I chose Visual Studio Code. It connects directly to my development EC2 instance, making it easy to edit code and manage files in the cloud.
- **GitHub**: All my web app code is stored and versioned in this GitHub repository.
- **AWS CodeArtifact**: Once it's rolled out, CodeArtifact will store my artifacts and dependencies, which is great for high availability and speeding up my project's build process.
- **AWS CodeBuild**: Once it's rolled out, CodeBuild will take over my build process. It'll compile the source code, run tests, and produce ready-to-deploy software packages automatically.
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: Once it's rolled out, CodeDeploy will automate my deployment process across EC2 instances.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Once it's rolled out, CodePipeline will automate the entire process from GitHub to CodeDeploy, integrating build, test, and deployment steps into one efficient workflow.

## Conclusion
Thank you for exploring this project! I'll continue to build this pipeline and apply my learnings to future projects.
